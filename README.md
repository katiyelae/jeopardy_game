# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write something. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that tenfold.

# Optimizations
For this game, one way I would optimize this project is by filtering out categories prior to a certain year. When testing the site a few times to see what categories pop up I noticed that sometimes no categories populate in the category boxes due to an API fetch error. I believe that filtering categories from recent years would help reduce the chance of this happening.    

# Lessons Learned:
- I didn't realize how much JS could make coding/creating HTML and CSS elements easier. You can create the styling for elements or add new elements to HTML/CSS files without having to type out 10+ li or div elements all at once. Such a game-changer!!
